# Agendas Alignment

## Premise

Implementation of a solution in a scenario where different people (represented as Agents) with different schedules are supposed to attend the same meetings. The goal is to schedule said meeting at the best possible time using the [JADE](http://jade.tilab.com/) Framework.

## Usage

To run this project, simply compile it and run the "Person.java" file. Browse to the "Main-Container" dropdown in the JADE window, create a new Agent with a valid name, the class "Agents.person" and use "manager" as the arguments.

You can then write the name of the meeting in the console, along with all the attendees and the meetinggs. duration and the result should be the best meeting time for the input settings
